This app is for users who have use the Transact ISP (previously NCABLE) in victoria.  For some reason
Transact does not expose QuotaXML for Victorian customers (and I have emailed asking why!), so as a 
first attempt at writing an android app, this is it.

Its still really buggy, and needs more work.

Also because of transacts own restrictions this app will not be able to load your quota info unless
you are using WIFI that is connected to the internet via your transact modem!
