This app is for users who have use the Transact ISP (previously NCABLE) in victoria.  

For some reason Transact does not expose QuotaXML for Victorian customers (and I 
have emailed asking why!), so as a first attempt at writing an android app, this is it.

Also because of transacts own restrictions this app will not be able to load your quota
info unless you are using WIFI that is connected to the internet via your transact modem!

TODO - I am working on a SSH Tunnel to allow communication with Transact via your local
environment if you expose a SSH server which supports port forwarding.
